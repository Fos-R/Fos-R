Fos-R is a high-quality and high-throughput network traffic generator based on AI models. Fos-R can be used for:

- creating in a few minutes network datasets lasting for weeks, for example to learn AI models or to evaluate intrusion detection systems;
- generating background traffic in cyber ranges so the exercise is more realistic and attacks are more difficult to detect;
- generating background traffic in low- or high-interactivity honeypots to deceive attackers.
