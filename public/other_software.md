# Fos-R & other software

## Wireshark

To visualize easily the taint on packets generated by Fos-R on Wireshark, right click on any column name > `Column Preferences...` > `+`. Set the fields of the new column as follow:

- Title: `Fos-R`
- Type: `Custom`
- Custom Expression: `ip.flags&4>0`
- Field occurrence: `0`.

Finally, consider moving the column up in the columns list.

## URSID

Integration of Fos-R into [URSID](https://gitlab.inria.fr/pirat-public/ursid) is still a work in progress.
