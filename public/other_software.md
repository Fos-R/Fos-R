# Fos-R & other software

Feel free to contact us if you would like some help integrating Fos-R in your tool!

## Wireshark

To visualize easily the taint on packets generated by Fos-R on Wireshark, right click on any column name > `Column Preferences...` > `+`. Set the fields of the new column as follow:

- Title: `Fos-R`
- Type: `Custom`
- Custom Expression: `ip.flags&4>0`
- Field occurrence: `0`.

Finally, consider moving the column up in the columns list.

Alternatively, you can modify the configuration file of Wireshark and add the line `"Fos-R", "%Cus:ip.flags&4>0:0:R"` in the `gui.column.format` list.
