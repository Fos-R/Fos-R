# Limitations

While Fos-R aims to produce high-quality generation, it still relies on some assumptions and is not suitable for all use cases. Here is what Fos-R should *not* be used for:

- works relying on deep packet inspection (DPI). The payloads generated by Fos-R are replayed and may be semantically incorrect.
- works for advanced networking analysis. Fos-R does not simulate caching or routing. Besides, it simulates an omniscient sensor that would magically capture all emitted packets.
- anonymizing a dataset. Fos-R has no guarantee about the privacy protection of the training data.
