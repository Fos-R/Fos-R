# FosR - Generation

The generation is split in three stages. Each stage has its own directory.

At the root of the projects, there are some files that describes structures used in several stages. It consist of :
- IP transport layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP);
- various structures in `struct.rs`.

Let us describe the three stages of the generation.

## Stage 1: netflow generation

This step in based on the FlowChronicle tool. Using as input the set of learned patterns,it generates new netflow records by first sampling patterns and then sampling non-fixed values inside these patterns.

It output a list of Flow (defined in `struct.rs`).

## Stage 2: intermediate representation generation

This step is based on the TADAM tool. Using the flows generated by stage 1, it creates a list of PacketsIR<T>, where T is a transport protocol. Each PacketsIR<T> corresponds to a flow between two IP addresses. This structure contains the original flow (generated by stage 1) with the metadata of the flow. There is also a vector packets_info that contains some information about the packet header: packet direction (forward or backward), payload size and type, timestamp, and TCP flags when the transport protocol is TCP.

## Stage 3: packet generation

Stages 3 create a list of complete packets by completing the information given by the output of stage 2.
